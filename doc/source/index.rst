Welcome to the pyglfw-cffi documentation!

.. note:: The official Home Page of pyglfw-cffi is located at |pyglfw-cffi-Url|

    If you are at http://readthedocs.org then you are reading the so called *latest documentation*.

    The *latest documentation* |pyglfw-cffi@readthedocs-badge| is automatically built from the
    git repository after each commit.

    As opposite the |pyglfw-cffi-HomePage|_ is built manually and is thus less prone to errors.
